My main goal in any profession in any companies where I worked is ***self-improvement*** and ***continuous professional growth of skills***. Now I don‚Äôt have enough *workflow that would create new unusual tasks every day and would require finding for a solution*.

And it gives me particular pleasure when the unusual task finds a creative solution.
