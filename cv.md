#### 3. Summary 
> Some kind of self-presentation **(your goal, wishes, reveal what is important for you, what do you want and why)**. 

My main goal in any profession in any companies where I worked is ***self-improvement*** and ***continuous professional growth of skills***. Now I don‚Äôt have enough *workflow that would create new unusual tasks every day and would require finding for a solution*. And I‚Äôm sure that **the creation of Apps is a team creative process that requires daily solution of tasks that require continuous self-study and -development**. And it gives me particular pleasure when the unusual task finds a creative solution.
